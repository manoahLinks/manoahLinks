### 🧭 Mission
I turn ambitious concepts into polished, end-to-end decentralized applications. Whether it's a playful on-chain experiment or a scalable product, I love building experiences that feel intuitive, human, and fast.

### 🔥 What I’m focused on now
- Architecting full-stack DApps with clean, maintainable systems
- Exploring Dojo / Starknet game mechanics and deployment workflows
- Rapid prototyping tooling for founders who need to get to market yesterday
- Building partnerships with founders, artists, and communities that want to experiment on-chain

### 🧰 Toolbox
- **Languages:** TypeScript, Rust, Solidity, Cairo (just enough to be dangerous)
- **Stacks:** Dojo, Starknet, Next.js, Node.js, React, Supabase, Postgres
- **Infra & DevEx:** Docker, Foundry, Hardhat, sozo, Katana, GitHub Actions
- **What I bring:** shipping velocity, empathy for users, clean architecture, sharp documentation
